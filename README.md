## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`

Your unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.

Use `yarn build` to recompile after editing.

`dist` contains the Chrome extension. You can delete `js/*`, as its contents will be regenerated by `webpack`, but the rest of the contents of `dist` will not.
